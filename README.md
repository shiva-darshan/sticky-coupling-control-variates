# Coupling Based Control Variates for Sensitivity Analysis

This repository contains the Julia code used to produce the numerical examples in the article "Sticky coupling as a control variate for sensitivity analysis" by S. Darshan, A. Eberle, G. Stoltz [arxiv:2409.15500](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15500).

These simulations were run with Julia 1.8.2 and the code should work with Julia 1.8 or later. Figures were made with script file `make_figs.jl`
